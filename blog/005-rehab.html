			<h3>WEBWASTE: Time for websites to go to Redesign Rehab?</h3> 
			<h4>Websites are in bad shape</h4>
			<img src="../img/05-fashionecom-rehab.jpg" alt="Fashion E-commerce Rehab">
			<p>â€¢ Between 2003 and 2019, the average webpage weight grew from about 100KB to about 4MB. The average time it takes to fully load a webpage is 10.3 seconds on desktop and 27.3 seconds on mobile.</p>
			<p>â€¢ The causes of webpage bloat? <i>Images, videos and 3rd party scripts</i> are mainly to blame. You think youâ€™re accessing one website or app, but then all these other 3rd parties start accessing you. The top 50 most visited websites have an average of 22 third-party websites hanging off them.</p>


			<h4>Why is this a problem?</h4>
			<p>â€¢ Because people hate when websites donâ€™t perform well. Study after study shows that people absolutely hate slow web pages. In 2018, Google research found that 53% of mobile site visitors left a page that took longer than 3 seconds to load.<br>
			â€¢ And at the same time, <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/11/22/finding-a-new-level-for-ecommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-commerce grew by 35%</a>. Well we spent a year at home on the internet...<br>
			â€¢ The problem is that the conversion rate for ecommerce websites is very sensitive. A 100-millisecond delay in website load time can hurt conversion rates by 7% <a href="https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/about/news/press/2017-press/akamai-releases-spring-2017-state-of-online-retail-performance-report.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Akamai</a>.<br>
			â€¢ In other terms, <strong>technical debt is an opportunity cost!</strong> Every penny invested in improving your e-commerce site will bring many more pennies. But for some reasons many large companies still consider that their website is an <i>online PowerPoint</i> and prefer to put their money in stores they happened to close due to covid. For this read our review of <a href="https://fashionweb.io/blog/002-prada-a-baby-website.html">Prada.com</a> and <a href="https://fashionweb.io/blog/003-miss-default-dior.html">Dior.com</a>.</p>

			
			<h4>The solution?</h4>
			<p>â€¢ <strong>Delete.</strong> There is a tremendous amount of out-of-date content on websites.<br>
				â€¢ <strong>Refactor.</strong> Poorly written, out-of-date code is also a major problem. By cleaning up its JavaScript code, Wikipedia estimated that they saved 4.3 terabytes a day of data bandwidth for their visitors.<br>
				â€¢ <strong>Clean up the visual language</strong>. Create a design system. Before you add any visual element, make sure that it does something useful and itâ€™s the most optimized image possible. Work with digital agencies who think about the page weight of every design decision they make.<br>
				â€¢ <strong>Redesign is rehab for websites.</strong> Every 2-3 years some manager either gets bored with the design or some other manager meets a customer who tells them about how horrible it is to find anything on the website. A Redesign project is the perfect opportunity for the digital design/UX team to round up both top and low-level pages and for developers to ditch the spaghetti codebase. <br>
				â€¢ <strong>No budget for a Redesign?</strong> If you must do something, do something useful. That often means not doing any projects before you first: remove, minimize and clean up.</p>
