			<h3>Balenciaga created a video game for their Spring/Summer 2021 presentation</h3> 
			<img src="../img/05-balenciaga-videogame.gif" alt="balenciaga video game">

			<p>Due to covid-19 being in full swing the big brands had to think long and hard about what exactly they should do for their Spring/Summer 2021 collections. Here are the highlights: </p>
			<p>• <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/747647002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prada did a “livestream”</a> of their fashion show which ended with a Q&A with Rick Owens and Miuccia Prada. Prada’s show didn’t look like a real livestream at all, more like a high production recording that took a whole day to film. We don’t mind though, no point having a “live” livestream really. <br>
			• <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Burberry cleverly partnered with Twitch</a> for their livestream<br>
			• Jacquemus had a socially distanced show in a wheat field and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vTYQWNFgTU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestreamed</a> it <br>
			• Gucci hosted their own fashion week called “<a href="https://www.guccifest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GucciFest</a>” collaborating with Gus Van Sant on their 7 part video series. Our attention span didn’t make it past the first episode unfortunately. <br>
			• <a href="https://www.chanel.com/fr/mode/collection/metiers-art-2020-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chanel had their show in a castle</a> and they only had one guest watching the show: Kristen Stewart. Weeeeeeiiiird. We hope she tested negative...<br>
			• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cmolbk0EWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acne Studios</a> did a classic livestream at the empty Grand Palais<br>
			• Balenciaga on the other hand went all in and created an <a href="https://videogame.balenciaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online videogame</a> dedicated to their new collection - it’s something we would only expect from Demna Gvasalia. <br></p>

			<p>The game is called <a href="https://videogame.balenciaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Afterworld: The Age of Tomorrow</i></a> and it’s a simulation taking you through a digital world that Balenciaga created where the characters are wearing the brand’s spring/summer 2021 collection. The entire simulation [we call it a simulation and not a game since you are just walking a pathway instead of playing] takes place for around 15 minutes. It starts with an intro where you roll through the “characters” like in a 90s fighting game detailing the garments in each look [check out the animated GIF above].</p>

			<p>You then transition into a Blade Runner-esque world based in a concrete building perhaps in a big metropolitan city, where the models are showcasing the new collection while standing around, browsing on their phones or taking selfies. </p>

			<p>You then walk through 5 zones, all zones looking apocalyptic. See this “Bringing life back to earth” ad in their game below, indicating a scary future.</p>

			<p>There is a small story in the game and it’s very very much fitting for Balenciaga’s brand and current creative direction. <span class="spoiler-alert">*SPOILER ALERT, highlight to read*</span> <span class="spoiler">We thought the story would end when we arrive to a rave in the forest, but we continued from there, bypassing models dancing high on life </span><span class="spoiler-alert">*SPOILER ALERT OVER*</p>
			

			<p>If this was a contest, hands down we would give Balenciaga the golden medal 🥇 for their spring/summer 2021 presentation.</p>

				<h4><span>FINAL THOUGHTS</span></h4>
				<p>Phew, all these brands’ Marketing and Digital departments must have been sweating hard from all that digital thinking this year. A for effort guys! We will be watching you again in 6 months.</p>
