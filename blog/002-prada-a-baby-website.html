			<h3>fashionweb review: PRADA.com</h3>
			<h4><a href="https://prada.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prada.com</a>: a baby website for a century old luxury brand</h4>
			<p>Our website review series will commence with Prada.com. The Italian fashion house has been amongst the big brands who have been lagging behind with their digital transformation: they started selling on Net-A-Porter/Mr Porter in 2016, and they only entered e-commerce in China at the end of 2017. They are waking up to the realisation that people want to shop online.</p>
			<img src="../img/02-prada-desktop.jpg" alt="Prada.com desktop homepage"><br>
			<h4>A six-year-long awakening</h4>
			<p>When Prada’s CEO Patrizio Bertelli <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/prada-needs-more-than-a-tune-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was asked</a> in 2014 ‘why not e-commerce’, he responded that he has “more important things to do, like opening stores, for example.” It took the 74-year-old CEO two years before <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/patrizio-bertelli-prada-politics-10714513/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he admitted</a> in a strange way in 2016 that “E-commerce was very American and now it’s moving also to Europe and very strongly in China.”</p>
			<p>Three more years pass and in March 2019, Prada reported a 17.6 percent decline in net profits and posted a 10 percent fall in operating profit of €324M. Perhaps Patrizio Bertelli has been finally enlightened by now that shopping online is not something only Americans like doing and hopefully he understands the importance of expanding into e-commerce.</p>
			<p>It seems like over these years he got the memo, since Prada has redesigned their website at the end of 2019 and promised to roll out their new e-commerce platform to more markets by 2020. Let’s dig deeper into their website here on fashionweb.io</p>


			<h4>Web Design: </h4>
			<p>➕ Sleek luxury feel, the usual white/grey/black color palette is being used, just like 99% of all other luxury e-commerce brands. <i>*yawn*</i>? Not exactly. No revolutionary design, but that is completely fine - it’s ok to put more creativity into campaigns and products which are accurately displayed on the website. </p>
			
			<h4>UX/UI:</h4>
			<p>➖ Mobile navigation feels too slow and sometimes flickering. You have to tap and make multiple selections in order to view a product. For example when I wanted to check their new mini bags, it took me 4 taps to get there where the mobile navigation was slow to respond to my taps. Feels like my time is being wasted as I am tapping many times to finally look at what I was looking for.<br>
			➖ When I searched for “mini bags”, I didn’t get the mini bag <a href="https://www.prada.com/ww/en/women/bags/mini_bags/products.re-edition_2000_nylon_mini_bag.1NE515_2DH0_F0638.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that I was looking for</a> listed as a search result. Again, my time is being wasted and I might not buy this bag if I am in a hurry.<br>
			<img src="../img/02-prada-search.jpg" class="mobile-screen" alt="Prada.com mobile search page"><br>
			➖ A lot of space is lost on mobile on certain Categories pages [Product Listing Pages, like Bags]. <br>
			<img src="../img/02-prada-readytowear.jpg" class="mobile-screen" alt="Prada.com mobile ready to wear page"><br></p>

			
			<h4>Product photography: </h4>
			<p>➕ High quality product images, it’s clear to see what I am buying. <br>
			<p>➖ Product photography could be improved and be more creative that communicates the Prada brand. <br>
			➖ Certain pages on mobile have too low-res images which was overlooked by the luxury brand. Most people who shop for luxury items have the best and most expensive devices with high-res displays. A low-res image makes everything look cheap.</p>
			<img src="../img/02-prada-bags.jpg" class="mobile-screen" alt="Prada.com mobile bags page"><br>
			
			<h4>Speed</h4>
			<p>➖ Perceived loading time feels ok. When looking at <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lighthouse</a> tests, there is a lot to improve in their javascript stack as it’s slowing down the site considerably. Friendly reminder: Speed if important and it has a large, measurable effect on conversion rates. In fact it is so important that it will deserve a specific fashionweb.io article.</p>
			<img src="../img/02-prada-lighthouse.jpg" alt="Prada.com lighthouse scores"><br>
			<p>➖ Long and ugly URLs that impact SEO negatively. They need to use canonicalisation. <a href="https://www.prada.com/gb/en/men/shoes/sneakers/products.prax_01_leather_and_technical_fabric_slip-on_sneakers.4D3480_3KYU_F0002_F_G000.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.prada.com/gb/en/men/shoes/sneakers/products.prax_01_leather_and_technical_fabric_slip-on_sneakers.4D3480_3KYU_F0002_F_G000.html</a></p>

			<h4>Checkout</h4>
			<p>➕ Kudos for having a single page checkout, a customer can have a quick glance at the entire checkout, not having to go through them step-by-step. <br>
			➖ Unable to preview the Payment methods in the Checkout... Why not? 🤔</p>
			<br>

				<h4><span>REVIEW TIME</span></h4>
				<p><span>LOOK AND FEEL:</span> 👜👜👜 [3 out of 5 handbags]<br>Nothing revolutionary, actually it's even boring but that’s fine. They are following best practices most of the time. Usual black/white/grey colour palette is used, just like all the other fashion brands.</p>
				<p><span>WEB PERFORMANCE: </span>👜👜 [2 out of 5 handbags]<br>We know you are late but it is not an excuse. Catch up faster!  Advice: good to look at webspeed stats and work on those numbers. Your conversion will thank you for it. </p>
				<p><span>FASHIONWEB.IO's ARBITRARY FEELING: </span>👜👜👜👜 [4 out of 5 handbags]<br>We are seeing a good trend from <a href="https://prada.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRADA.com</a> and it has to be rewarded. We will judge here how brands move forward with e-commerce, and not only their current state. So we encourage this baby website that PRADA has produced as 
				they have finally realised how important their e-commerce is and investing more into this precious field. Well done, keep going! Or else you will be quickly left behind... again...</p>
